## Cost Comparisons [name subject to change]

### Overview
General idea: allow the user to frame the cost of various federal spending programs to reference points that would be familiar to the average consumer (e.g. a meal, an appliance, a car, a house, etc.). Cost of these programs would be framed both in the aggregate (DOD budget = 20M new cars) and on a per citizen/per taxpayer basis, nationally and within states (Medicare = 9 Big Macs per person per week for a year). Unclear whether I'll be able to find a programmatic reference for references--may have to find manually.
